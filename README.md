# Mission-to-Mars

# Summary
This project is designed to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Flask is used to deploy the scraped data to the HTML. A Scrape New Data button is created to scrape Mars-related data from the websites listed below.

# Outcomes

The webpage outcome includes featured image and mars facts with scrape button to visualize the whole webpage and news title. Also, the pictures of mars hemispheres.
The difficult part was to centre the data using html css bootstrap in this case.
